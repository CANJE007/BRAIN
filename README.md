# BRAIN
BRAIN SIMULATION VIA MULTI PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE
The concept is to create a 3 dimensional array of microcontrollers to broadly replicate the communication between different elements of the human brain.
Each microcontroller has 'direct' communications with 8 to 16 other microcontrollers in the array
Each controller can process commands or requests or pass them on (pipeline) to more distant controllers (indirect communications) thus expanding and extending the addresability.
The programs in each of them will be broadly the same although some slight variations will exist in some areas
The initial array will be 3x3x3 (27) for testing the concept and the next being 27x27x27(19683)
The architecture will connect to stimulii inputs and control outputs via peripheral neuron controllers
Learning will evolve from observing input stimulii variations as responses to control outputs 
The underlying processing principal is of contemporaneous activity of all microcontrollers as compared to sequential task processing of conventional cpus ( even modern multi-core, multi-thread chips have limited capacity for parallel processing )
Each controller's function within the overall context of the brain will evolve according to the extent of demands placed on it
The total 'experience' and learning will contribute to the development of the communications arhitecture.
More frequent stimullii of the same type along particular pathways will reinforce the 'memory' and make it easier to recall.
Less frequent communication through particular pathways wil have reduced importance and over time may eventually be lost. i.e cannot be recalled
Although the communications pathways allow every controller to communicate with all other controllers, only a limited number of pathways are likely to communcate at the same time depending on the thought processes.
Each controller has its own clock and comms between controllers is asynchrous so controller to controller comms is not influenced by other comms in the array
the integrity of the overall array is determined by the ability of each controller to set arithmetic or logic tests to other controllers. If the majority of tests are succesfully passed then the controller continues to perform its normal role but if the majority of tests fail then the controller is taken out of service.
The writer is looking for suggestions of reasonably priced microcontroller card with 8 or more serial communications and enough RAM and ROM to provide support
